### Restart-path validation (`internal/engine/executor`)

Harness note on 2026-03-14: the restart benchmark now clones the seeded WAL/snapshot fixture per iteration before timing starts, so persisted-snapshot runs no longer accumulate extra checkpoint files between iterations.

## Notes

- This baseline is deterministic in workload shape and command path.
- Values are hardware/OS dependent and serve as a regression reference, not cross-machine SLA numbers.
- The restart/replay numbers above are useful internal evidence but are not closure-grade AB evidence yet.
- Current restart-path interpretation:
	- replay-to-LSN is now benchmarked with a stable repeated sample around ~`2.0 ms/op` on this fixture;
	- after fixing the restart benchmark harness and removing one extra deep copy during snapshot materialization, the persisted-snapshot path is much closer to replay-only and now allocates materially less, but it is still not yet faster on this fixture, so snapshot-load work remains open rather than justified for closure;
	- the new focused split shows the persisted restart cost is dominated by snapshot-directory read/decompress/decode/materialization (~`429 µs/op`), while the in-memory `replayFromSnapshots` restore step itself is comparatively small (~`60 µs/op`);
	- inside the snapshot-directory load, binary decode is currently the largest measured in-process component (~`192 µs/op` and ~`470 KB/op`), ahead of zstd decompression (~`74 µs/op`) and snapshot materialization (~`49 µs/op`), with the remaining gap attributable largely to file reads and surrounding glue work.
- Current read-path interpretation:
	- on the simple covered ordered-read shape, `btree-index-only` is about $10\times$ faster than `btree-order` and materially reduces allocations;
	- adding `OFFSET` to the covered ordered-read shape still keeps `btree-index-only` comfortably fast (about $1.7\times$ slower than the zero-offset variant, but still far below row-fetch ordered reads);
	- on the selective covered shape, adding bounded early-stop to the index-only path moved it ahead of `btree-order` as well (~`274 µs/op` vs ~`406 µs/op`), while keeping allocations materially lower.
	- on the composite covered ordered-read shape, enabling composite index-only coverage moved the path to ~`36 µs/op` versus ~`76–78 µs/op` for the non-covered row-fetch path, with materially lower allocations.
