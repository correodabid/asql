## Results

### Engine (`internal/engine/executor`)

- `BenchmarkEngineWriteCommit-8`: `69,430 ns/op`, `4,248 B/op`, `62 allocs/op`
- `BenchmarkEngineReadAsOfLSN-8`: `5,038,622 ns/op`, `3,178,457 B/op`, `39,126 allocs/op`
- `BenchmarkEngineReplayToLSN-8`: `4,794,214 ns/op`, `2,631,836 B/op`, `37,097 allocs/op`

### WAL (`internal/storage/wal`)

- `BenchmarkFileLogStoreAppend-8`: `24,561 ns/op`, `573 B/op`, `6 allocs/op`
- `BenchmarkFileLogStoreReadFrom-8`: `15,634,191 ns/op`, `5,593,017 B/op`, `60,029 allocs/op`
- `BenchmarkFileLogStoreRecover-8`: `13,377,896 ns/op`, `5,592,932 B/op`, `60,028 allocs/op`

### Restart-path validation (`internal/engine/executor`)

Harness note on 2026-03-14: the restart benchmark now clones the seeded WAL/snapshot fixture per iteration before timing starts, so persisted-snapshot runs no longer accumulate extra checkpoint files between iterations.

Repeated sample on 2026-03-14 using isolated fixtures and `go test ./internal/engine/executor -run '^$' -bench '^BenchmarkEngineRestart...$' -benchmem -benchtime=200ms -count=2`:

- `BenchmarkEngineRestartReplayOnly-8`: `3,330,478–3,413,274 ns/op`, `2,303,626–2,303,673 B/op`, `15,573 allocs/op`
- `BenchmarkEngineRestartFromPersistedSnapshot-8`: `3,910,771–3,918,000 ns/op`, `1,122,907–1,123,694 B/op`, `6,309 allocs/op`

Scope note on 2026-03-14: the current `BenchmarkEngineRestartFromPersistedSnapshot` fixture calls `WaitPendingSnapshots()` before shutdown, so it benchmarks a head snapshot plus effectively `0` trailing WAL records rather than a snapshot plus a non-zero replay tail.

## Notes

- This baseline is deterministic in workload shape and command path.
- Values are hardware/OS dependent and serve as a regression reference, not cross-machine SLA numbers.
- The restart/replay numbers above are useful internal evidence but are not closure-grade AB evidence yet.
- Current restart-path interpretation:
	- replay-to-LSN is now benchmarked with a stable repeated sample around ~`2.0 ms/op` on this fixture;
	- the current end-to-end restart comparison is a head-snapshot best-case (`0` post-snapshot replay records), so it is good for measuring raw snapshot-load overhead but not for choosing snapshot cadence by itself;
	- after fixing the restart benchmark harness, removing one extra deep copy during snapshot materialization, reducing dictionary-string allocation in the binary decoder, and decoding table rows directly into positional slices, the persisted-snapshot path is now much closer to replay-only on repeated runs while still allocating materially less, but it is still slower on this fixture, so snapshot-load work remains open rather than justified for closure;
	- the repeated longer-benchtime sample now shows persisted-snapshot restart stabilizing around ~`3.91 ms/op` versus ~`3.33–3.41 ms/op` for replay-only, while cutting restart allocations to ~`1.12 MB/op` and ~`6.3k allocs/op`;
	- new spot-check benchmarks now separate two different questions: how much a fixed snapshot anchor helps as the replay tail grows, and how the current adaptive cadence behaves when the engine skips roughly one full interval then replays only the last ~`500` records;
	- on the current M1 spot checks, a snapshot plus ~`500` replayed records clearly beats replay-only at ~`1k` total rows (`12.7 ms` vs `16.2 ms`) and around the current medium anchor of ~`10.5k` total rows (`57.6 ms` vs `95.8 ms`), while the win narrows again by ~`50.5k` total rows (`289.9 ms` vs `307.1 ms`), so cadence is materially workload-size dependent and should be tuned with these sweeps rather than inferred from the old best-case restart fixture alone;
	- the new workload-shape sweep also confirms that “same tail length” is not enough by itself: with a default 500-record anchor, append-heavy restart remained in the ~`16–21 ms` range while update-heavy and delete-heavy shapes landed around ~`270–278 ms`, so mutation mix has to be treated as a first-class input to any eventual snapshot-cadence policy;
	- repeated workload runs now tighten that result: at the default 500-record anchor, persisted snapshots are clearly worse for `insert_heavy` (~`9.8–10.8 ms` vs ~`8.0–8.4 ms` replay-only) but modestly better for `update_heavy` (~`266–281 ms` vs ~`277–302 ms`) and `delete_heavy` (~`275–282 ms` vs ~`288–292 ms`), while also shaving a small amount of memory and allocations in all three shapes;
	- the repeated workload-cadence runs strengthen that policy signal: with a 500-record anchor, `insert_heavy` is consistently worse at the small checkpoint (~`22.1–22.3 ms` vs ~`8.7–15.6 ms`) but clearly better by the medium checkpoint (~`61.3–62.3 ms` vs ~`95.9–101.5 ms`), while `update_heavy` and `delete_heavy` are already break-even-to-better at the small anchor and widen their absolute savings by the medium anchor;
	- memory follows the same pattern: by the medium anchor, persisted snapshots cut restart allocation volume materially for `insert_heavy` (~`35.6 MB` vs ~`62.1–62.4 MB`) and trim it modestly for `update_heavy`/`delete_heavy`, so the cadence choice affects both wall-clock restart time and heap pressure;
	- candidate policy from the current evidence: keep the existing volume-based anchors in [internal/engine/executor/snapshot.go](internal/engine/executor/snapshot.go#L10-L24) as the base interval, but modulate them with a recent mutation-mix score for persisted checkpoints — roughly “append-heavy => keep or widen, update/delete-heavy => shrink”; a practical first pass would be a rolling window over recent WAL mutations with weights such as `insert=1`, `update=4`, `delete=3`, halving the current interval when weighted update/delete pressure dominates and leaving it unchanged for mostly-insert workloads;
	- the same evidence suggests we should treat disk and memory policy separately: restart-path gains come from persisted checkpoints, while hot-path historical queries first hit the in-memory snapshot store, so the first adaptive policy change should target persisted checkpoint cadence before changing in-memory snapshot retention;
	- the focused split shows the persisted restart cost is still dominated by snapshot-directory read/decompress/decode/materialization (~`302–377 µs/op`), while the in-memory `replayFromSnapshots` restore step itself is comparatively small (~`60 µs/op`);
	- inside the snapshot-directory load, binary decode remains the largest measured in-process component, but the direct positional-row decode path pushed it down materially to roughly `79–166 µs/op`, `186–458 KB/op`, and `1.1k–1.7k allocs/op`, ahead of raw file I/O (~`87 µs/op`), zstd decompression (~`74 µs/op`), and snapshot materialization (~`49–57 µs/op`);
	- delta-chain merge is negligible on the current fixture because the harness is effectively loading a single persisted snapshot file, so this AB slice is presently about file read + decode efficiency rather than cross-file snapshot chaining.
	- an index-rich snapshot fixture (primary key + hash + btree persisted) raises full snapshot-directory load to about `493 µs/op`, but decode still stays in the same order of magnitude (~`167 µs/op`), so persisted index payload is not causing a new dominant hotspot beyond the existing file-read + decode path.
	- removing the extra raw-file accumulation pass in `readAllSnapshotsFromDir()` did not materially shift the measured timings on the current fixture, which further suggests the remaining opportunity is inside file-read/decompress/decode itself rather than in the old two-pass control flow.
	- a direct full-snapshot decode experiment using `decodeSnapshotsBinary()` did not show a compelling win over the current raw-decode + materialize path on either the base or index-rich fixture, so a larger refactor toward that direct path is not yet justified by the current evidence.
	- the positional-row decode change clearly improved isolated decode and snapshot-directory load benchmarks, but the end-to-end persisted-restart timing is still noisy on the current short benchtime harness and needs repeated confirmation before any closure claim.
- Current read-path interpretation:
	- on the simple covered ordered-read shape, `btree-index-only` is about $10\times$ faster than `btree-order` and materially reduces allocations;
	- adding `OFFSET` to the covered ordered-read shape still keeps `btree-index-only` comfortably fast (about $1.7\times$ slower than the zero-offset variant, but still far below row-fetch ordered reads);
	- on the selective covered shape, adding bounded early-stop to the index-only path moved it ahead of `btree-order` as well (~`274 µs/op` vs ~`406 µs/op`), while keeping allocations materially lower.
	- on the composite covered ordered-read shape, enabling composite index-only coverage moved the path to ~`36 µs/op` versus ~`76–78 µs/op` for the non-covered row-fetch path, with materially lower allocations.
